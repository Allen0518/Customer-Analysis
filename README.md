# Customer-Analysis
Customer Behavior Analysis Project
Introduction:
In the dynamic landscape of today's business environment, gaining insights into customer behavior is paramount for companies aiming to thrive and excel in their respective markets. This data analysis project is designed to extract valuable insights from a robust dataset encompassing diverse attributes related to customer demographics, spending patterns, and interactions with promotional campaigns. Leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, our objective is to provide actionable information to optimize business strategies and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset at hand encompasses a wide array of information, including customer personal details like birth year, education level, marital status, and household income. It delves into purchasing habits across different product categories, responses to promotional campaigns, and preferred channels for making purchases. With this rich dataset, our goal is to explore correlations, identify trends, and build predictive models to address key business questions.

Project Highlights:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Utilizing Python libraries such as matplotlib and ggplot, we conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This involved visually representing the distribution of key variables, exploring their relationships with sales, and conducting simple correlation analyses. Visualizations provided a deep understanding of the dataset's characteristics and potential patterns.

2. Hypothesis Testing:
Various statistical methods, including ANOVA, t-test, and Pearson correlation analysis, were employed for hypothesis testing. This allowed us to rigorously analyze relationships between different variables, providing statistical evidence to support or refute hypotheses about customer behavior and preferences.

3. RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary):
We implemented the widely used RFM analysis in the marketing domain. By evaluating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary aspects, customers were categorized into segments. This analysis provides a foundation for devising targeted marketing strategies tailored to the specific needs and behaviors of each segment.

4. Clustering:
Both k-means and BIRCH clustering algorithms were applied for customer segmentation analysis. Beyond clustering, in-depth analysis of cluster results was conducted, using visually intuitive charts to examine the consumption characteristics of individual clusters. This assists decision-makers in implementing targeted marketing strategies based on distinct customer segments.
